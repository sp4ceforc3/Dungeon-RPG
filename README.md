# Dungeon-RPG
 In this exercise you will build a simple dungeon and add some enemies that can be fought in a turn-based battle system. The assets for this exercise can be found on the Assets tab. Important: The package contains multiple files. First import C2.unitypackage, which contains all of the graphics and audio clips. Then choose one of the Player.unitypackage files, depending on which input system you are using. Please use the included prefab for your player. You'll have to change this prefab for some of the tasks, but please don't remove any of the existing functionality. This is important for grading.
